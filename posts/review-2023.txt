b:Tb01,## 2023 Year Review!

- Employee’s basic information. For identification and analysis purposes, it is also important that you add a section where the employee’s basic information can be written, including their name, ID, and position in the company.
  Review period. To streamline the entire annual review process, it is critical that you add a section that states the period for which the review is being conducted.
- Tasks to be evaluated. This is the main section of the annual review template, so mention all the yearly goals for which the employee is being evaluated.
  Performance score rating. For each task mentioned earlier, make sure you leave adequate space where the reviewer can rate the employee's quality of work. You can do this through a 5-star review system, Likert scale or even by adding an empty box where reviewers can describe their evaluation. Some of

## What Is an Annual Review?

An annual review, or a year-end review, is the process of evaluating employee performance over the past year. Annual reviews are typically done by managers, but can also be self-conducted.

Generally, an annual performance assessment includes:

Tracking employee KPIs
Identifying employee's strengths and weaknesses
Measuring employee quality of work
Providing feedback on potential areas of improvement
Needless to say, an annual review is a critical part of any successful business.

It helps businesses identify high-performing employees, boost employee engagement, relay expectations, and help foster a progressive environment of growth and progress.

On the other hand, employees can also use this time to communicate their future expectations to the company; be it their next year's KPIs, personal goals, monetary compensation, bonus structure breakdown, or expected promotions.

At the end of an annual review, managers evaluate whether the company's future goals align with employees' objectives, and decide if they should be recommended for a raise or promotion in the coming year.

## How to Write a Year-End Review

When it comes to preparing for a year-end review, there isn’t any one-size-fits-all approach.

This is majorly due to the type of industry you’re in, and the fact that every employee has unique goals for which they’re being evaluated. But that doesn't mean that you can’t create a generic layout for all performance reviews.

In this section, we look at some of the most common sections you can add to your annual review templates:

Header. The header is the first thing that the reviewer and reviewee will notice on the annual review document, so it's a good idea to add your company’s name, logo and branding to give it an overall professional outlook. In Visme, you can upload your logo with a few clicks and add it to any project.
